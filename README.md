Pretty much all blog posts published on my website [Mathalope.co.uk](http://mathalope.co.uk]). are stored
in the form of gist and rendered via the WordPress interface. Links to the gists are included in each blog post.

See [this blog post](http://mathalope.co.uk/2015/03/29/how-i-write-scientific-blog-posts-that-contains-codes-and-mathematical-expressions-a-quick-reference-with-wordpress-gist-and-mathjax/) on
how I publish posts on the website.

Cheers,
Johnny
